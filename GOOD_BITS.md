# GOOD BITS

* Presentational Components
  * Components get data and callbacks from props.
  * Only a single Component needs to know about Stores, Actions, etc.

* Partially applying a component.
  * Allows us to separate out knowledge of Stores, Actions, etc from dynamically chosen Components.

* Component filenames match class names.
